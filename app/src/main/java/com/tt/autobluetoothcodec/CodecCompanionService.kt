/**
 * Applies the preferred codec of observed devices, see [CompanionPresence]. Since API 33 the system
 * keeps this service bound while such a device is present, which keeps the process out of the
 * background. On API 31 and 32 it only binds it for the callbacks. [A2dpConnectReceiver] applies
 * the preferred codec when A2DP connects too, for when the service doesn't run.
 *
 * A device appears as soon as its Bluetooth link connects, usually before A2DP is connected. So
 * while a device is present, a runtime receiver waits for A2DP to connect. Unlike the manifest
 * receiver it doesn't queue up behind other apps' receivers.
 *
 * Up to API 35 only the String callbacks are overridden: they exist since API 31, and the
 * AssociationInfo variants forward to them. Since API 36 the system calls them for each source a
 * device is seen on, BLE and its Bluetooth connection, and reports one source going while the other
 * stays. So there the service follows [onDevicePresenceEvent] instead, and a device is present while
 * any source reports it.
