/**
 * Applies codecs to connected devices and checks that they took effect, trying again a few times
 * if they didn't. A codec counts as applied once two reads in a row, [VERIFY_DELAY_MILLIS] apart,
 * report it: right after A2DP connects the S24 sometimes changes the codec back to its own choice
 * while the codec it reports still lags behind. There is one applier per process, so the requests of the UI, [CodecCompanionService]
 * and [A2dpConnectReceiver] are coordinated: each device has at most one pending request. A request
 * for a different codec supersedes the pending one, a request for the same codec is dropped.
 *
 * Must be used on the main thread. Each [apply] continues an operation of the [EventLog] and
 * resolves it, unless the operation is handed back to its onSecurityException callback.
 *
 * The profile proxy is opened by the first request and kept until Bluetooth turns off, keeping it
 * open only holds a binder reference. The applier reaches the profile through [A2dpAccess].
