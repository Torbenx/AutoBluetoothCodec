"""The SIM cards of a test phone: whether they're unlocked, and rebooting without losing their PIN.

A SIM with a PIN asks for it after every boot, on the lock screen before
the phone's own PIN or password. Whatever is typed while it asks counts as
a wrong SIM PIN, and the third one locks the SIM until its PUK is entered.
So the lock screen password is only typed once every SIM is loaded or absent.

Every reboot goes through unattended_reboot(): it stores the SIM PINs the
user entered, and after the reboot the phone enters them itself, before the
first unlock. The reboot has to follow within 20 s, the stored PINs stay
valid for 15 minutes. The phone's own unlock doesn't depend on it.

Checked on Android 9 and 12L (Pixel 3a, no SIM) and 16 (Galaxy S24, a SIM
with a PIN and an inactive eSIM).
