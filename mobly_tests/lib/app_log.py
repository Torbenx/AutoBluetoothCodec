"""The app's event log, the oracle for what the app did.

The log is a JSON Lines file in the app's private storage, read with run-as.
Reading it doesn't start or touch the app's process, so it works the same
with the app in front, in the background, killed or restarted. A label
broadcast marks a test step, but it starts the process if it isn't running,
so cold start tests don't send one inside their stimulus window.

Events are dicts as the app writes them: v, seq, time, type, opUID, device,
config, actual, attempt, message.
