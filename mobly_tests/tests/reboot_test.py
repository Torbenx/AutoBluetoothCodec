"""L4 tests that reboot the phone: C7 without a lock screen, C14, C15 and C16 with a secure lock screen that
is still locked when A2DP connects.

Before the first unlock after a boot, the app's credential protected storage
is encrypted. Its manifest receiver and companion service are direct boot
aware, so the system starts them anyway: the receiver applies the preferred
codec when A2DP connects, and the log keeps the events in a device protected
file until the unlock merges them. What happens per API level is in
TestConcept.md, below the C14 and C15 rows.

Which phones are rebooted depends on their lock screen (D24): a pure test
device gets the PIN 0000 for the locked reboot and loses it again, a
personal phone's password is typed, and a phone whose password isn't known
isn't rebooted. A locked reboot ends with a clean reboot (D26). Every
reboot is an unattended one, so a SIM with a PIN unlocks by itself.
