"""Prepare the test phones for a testing session and restore them afterwards.

Keep it running while testing, by hand or with Mobly, over as many attempts as
needed. Until Enter or Ctrl+C is pressed:

  * Bluetooth is off on every phone, so the Qudelix-5K can only connect to the
    phone under test. Tests turn it on for that phone and off again.
  * Screens stay on while plugged in, dimmed against OLED burn-in.
  * Every few seconds each phone is checked. A phone that isn't reachable over
    adb, isn't plugged in, has its screen off or is locked, and more than one
    phone with Bluetooth on, beeps and prints a warning. The end of the session
    lists every problem with its time, to tell which attempts it affected.

At the end every phone gets its original settings back. They're saved to a
state file before anything changes. If a session doesn't end normally, for
example because its window was closed, the next session reuses the saved
settings, or `restore` restores them right away.

The phones are all devices connected over adb when the session starts. Setup,
from this folder:
  python -m venv .venv
  .venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt   (.venv/bin/pip on Linux and macOS)

Usage:
  .venv/Scripts/python testbed_session.py
  .venv/Scripts/python testbed_session.py restore
